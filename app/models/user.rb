  # Note: Rails' update_attributes method takes a hash of attributes and their values and automatically updates them and saves the result. However if one of the attributes in the hash is not marked attr_accessible, no value for that attribute is stored to disk.  
  # Thus encrypted_password here? Does devise use update_attributes? 
  # Should pasword be an actual field? Should it be stored on the disk? 
  
  # for handling catelog requests
  
  # clinician<<->clinic relationship, but here for all users? when/how does this get set? 
  # seems like it could be set in register/new, register/edit?
  # Actually, I would like in clinic#update to allow the clinic administrator to register clinicians without
  # going through register/new and to set this there.  
  # Is there someway to make that happen â€” ie to invoke the register.new method without showing the registrations/new.html.erb view?  
  #Seems like I ought to be able to pass the same set of params that is being collected in registrations/new.html.erb to the url defined in the register_new path
